      <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>I'm an aspiring <strong>web developer</strong>, looking to conquer the world! I am also a self-taught graphic designer looking for more ways to improve.</p>

         <p>I'm currently a <strong>marketing professional</strong>, but as I became more honest with myself, I realized I liked to design and develop more. I read an article that said you'll know what you were made to do when you can stay up all night and enjoy every minute of your work. To me, that was trying to figure out basic CSS & HTML on Wordpress in order to make my websites look good.</p>

      <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
      <p>I grew up mostly in the east coast until I moved to California with my family by high school. I went to college at <strong>Cal State Long Beach</strong> and got my <strong>Bachelor's of Science in Marketing</strong>. I loved learning about practical skills in business. I think if I didn't do that, I wouldn't have been bold enough to dream that I could do more than be stuck at a 9-5 dead-end job. I now love the startup and entrepreneurship world!</p>
      <p>I think I will do well with online classes and time management. In college, I switched my major three times and still graduated in four years. I also skipped a lot of classes in favor of studying on my own more efficiently. It's fun but <em>really challenging.</em></p>

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      
      <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
      
      <p>I love graphic design, painting, hand lettering, and most forms of drawing. When I'm not staring at a screen or a notebook, I'm hiking, exploring different mountains, and road tripping with my husband.</p>
      
      <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
      
      <p>I'd love to know everything about front- and back-end developing so I can <strong>work when I want and where I want.</strong> I love being outside too much to stay in an office for eight hours straight.</p>
      
      <h3>What's your background?</h3>
      
      <p>Like a lot of people, I learned HTML and the ins and outs of websites from blogs. I started learning as early as middle school and continued from there to personal websites and of course, customizing my Myspace profile. After that, from loving websites and design in general, my interest grew.</p>
      
      <h3>What music have you been listening to?</h3>
      
      <p>I listen to a weird range of things. I'm not much for mainstream music but I do <strong>love folk, electronic, progressive rock and metal</strong>. Why don't you just listen for yourself? (Beware your ears on the last one if you don't like metal!)</p>
